## How to Install .NET Framework Version 3.5 on Windows 10
Before we head into installing .NET 3.5, it's a good idea to check if you've already installed it in the past:

    Press Win + R, type control, and press Enter to launch Control Panel.
    Click on Programs > Programs and Features.
    From the left pane, select Turn Windows features on or off.
    You'll see .NET 3.5 at the top of the list of Windows features. If the box besides .NET 3.5 is shaded in black, it's installed.

windows features list dotnet 3.5

Notice how there's a bracket that says that this version includes .NET 2.0 and 3.0. This means THAT when you install .NET Framework 3.5, you'll also be able to run any apps that require .NET 2.0 and 3.0.
